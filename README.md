# ***Library App :book:***
## Description
During my java learning I decided to try to make something working on Windows.
For this reason I checked javaFX documentation, h2 database (the only one I found to make it built-in).
So there is final version that everyone can download and launch.

### Launching
Download all files and launch `Library.exe.`
Use *admin* as login and *admin* as a :key:

### Settings
You can change log and pass using`settings image`.
To change email you have to put your email log and pass to `email.properties`.
if you use gmail, you have to make an app :key: and link this app.
